Mini-Project 8: JSON
====================

A simple JSON parser.

Implemented by David Rhoades, Lucas Willett, William Pitchford for CSC-207-01 2022Sp.

This is a parser that can read in JSON values (Strings, Real, Aarray, Constant, Integer) and creates JSON objects for them. Each JSON object
has a toString method that can be used to print them out. Also there is a fully functional chained hashtable with an iterator where we can store
Array lists of Pairs with type <JsonValue, JsonValue>.

Talked with Ishita about static finals

Boston helped us understand how to make our iterator for the hash table work: nested iterators

Used code from Lab-hashtables and MP8
